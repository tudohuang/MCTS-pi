# MCTS-pi: Approximating π with Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Introduction

Welcome to MCTS-pi, a project where the intriguing world of Monte Carlo simulations meets the mathematical constant π (pi). Here, we delve into a unique approach to approximating π, inspired by the principles of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - a technique often likened to the strategies used in the famed casino city, Monte Carlo.

## What is π?

π is the mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, a number that has fascinated mathematicians for centuries. Its value is approximately:

π = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164......

## The Monte Carlo Method for π

At the heart of our project is the Monte Carlo method, a technique that uses randomness and statistical probability to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. The method is named after the Monte Carlo Casino, reflecting its inherent nature of randomness and chance, much like the games of a casino.

## Our Approach: MCTS and π

In MCTS-pi, we leverage the concept of Monte Carlo simulations in a unique way. By randomly sampling points and employing the formula:

PI = 4 * c/n

where 'c' is the number of points that land inside a quarter circle, and 'n' is the total number of points, we approximate the value of π. This method not only provides an interesting perspective on computational mathematics but also showcases the versatility of Monte Carlo methods.
